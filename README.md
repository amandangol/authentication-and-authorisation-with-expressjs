# User Management System

This project is designed to manage users, allowing for profile updates and account deletion. It includes both user and admin functionalities, such as loading user profiles, updating information, and deleting accounts securely.

## Features

- **User Profile Management:** Users can view and update their profile information, including username, contact number, and email.
- **Delete Account:** Users can delete their accounts, which removes their data from the system.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Admins can view all users, edit user details, and delete users from the system.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend:** The frontend is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a simple and responsive interface for users and admins.
- **Backend:** The backend is powered by Express.js, handling requests related to user management, including authentication, authorization, and data management.
- **Security:** The application uses authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access certain features.

## Delete User Functionality: A Critical Analysis

### Requirement: "This delete user functionality can be done after authentication"

#### Is this a good idea?

Implementing the delete user functionality after authentication is both a necessary and prudent measure. However, it is important to differentiate between authentication and authorization, and understand how they contribute to a secure system.

#### Explanation:

1. **Authentication**:

   - **Definition**: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It ensures that the person trying to access the system is who they claim to be.
   - **Importance**: Without authentication, anyone could potentially perform actions within the system, including the deletion of user accounts. This could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.

2. **Authorization**:
   - **Definition**: Authorization, on the other hand, determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It ensures that even after a user is authenticated, they can only perform actions that they are permitted to.
   - **Importance**: Simply being authenticated should not give a user the right to delete any account. Authorization is necessary to enforce rules, such as only allowing users to delete their own accounts or permitting admins to delete any account.

#### Why Authentication Alone is Not Enough:

While authentication confirms a user's identity, it does not control what actions the user can perform. Therefore, implementing the delete functionality solely based on authentication could lead to security risks, such as:

- **Account Deletion by Malicious Users**: If a user gains unauthorized access to another user's credentials, they could delete accounts without proper checks.
- **Limited Control**: Without proper authorization, even authenticated users could perform actions outside their intended permissions, leading to potential misuse of the system.

#### The Role of Authorization in Secure Account Deletion:

Authorization ensures that:

- Only users with the correct permissions can delete accounts.
- Admins have the ability to manage all user accounts, while regular users can only delete their own accounts.
- The system remains secure, preventing unauthorized deletions.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the delete user functionality should definitely be performed after authentication, but it must also be tightly coupled with authorization to ensure that only users with the appropriate permissions can delete accounts. This combination is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the system.
